# Hubchain Mobile Tech Challenge

Hey Mobile developer. Welcome.

To protect the world from villains are hero's mission! Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to carve out up to 36 hours and create an mobile application to build up the best team using [Disney Marvel's Amazing API](https://developer.marvel.com/). Your application should show a random villain to be defeated and then allow a registered user to create an awesome 3-to-7 hero team.

> **Hey this is important!**
> We hope you can spend about 24 hours on this project. If you can finish faster -- great! If not, limit yourself and don't spend much longer than 36 hours MAX.
